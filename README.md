# COMS661project_AcademicKnolwedgeGraph
This project is aimed at creating a knowledge graph from DBLP dataset with author affiliations extracted from Google Scholar.
This implementation is based on a graph algorithm designed by renowned Computer science professors - Dr. Erik Demaine from MIT and Dr. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi from University of Maryland.  The algorithm has been modified to achieve the goal of this project.

The raw DBLP data (dblp.xml.gz and dblp.dtd) needs to be downloaded from https://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/ before executing the scripts.
